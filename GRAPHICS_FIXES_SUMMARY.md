# Graphics & Rendering Code Fixes Summary

## üõ†Ô∏è CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED

### 1. **Memory Leak Fixes**

#### **FilterManager.java - ThreadLocal Buffer Management**
- **Issue**: ThreadLocal buffers (`scratchBig`, `scratchSmall`, `bloomA`, `bloomB`) were never cleared, causing memory leaks
- **Fix**: Added `clearThreadLocalBuffers()` method and shutdown hook to clean up buffers
- **Impact**: Prevents memory accumulation in long-running applications

#### **SwingDisplayComponent.java - Graphics2D Resource Leak**
- **Issue**: Graphics2D objects created in `drawFpsOverlay()` could leak if exceptions occurred
- **Fix**: Wrapped graphics operations in try-finally block to ensure disposal
- **Impact**: Prevents resource leaks in overlay rendering

### 2. **Thread Safety Fixes**

#### **FilterManager.java - saveThread Race Condition**
- **Issue**: Multiple threads could create duplicate save threads simultaneously
- **Fix**: Added `saveThreadLock` synchronization around thread creation
- **Impact**: Prevents thread creation races and ensures single save thread

#### **FPSTool.java - Unsafe Static Field Access**
- **Issue**: Compound operations on volatile fields were not atomic
- **Fix**: Added `fpsLock` synchronization for frame counting operations
- **Impact**: Ensures thread-safe FPS calculations

#### **PerformanceManager.java - Thread Creation Race**
- **Issue**: Similar race condition in save preferences thread creation
- **Fix**: Added `savePreferencesThreadLock` for thread-safe creation
- **Impact**: Prevents duplicate save threads

### 3. **Null Pointer Exception Fixes**

#### **SwingDisplayComponent.java - Enhanced Null Checking**
- **Issue**: Missing null checks in `mapToDeviceCoordinates()` and `mouseMoved()`
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive null checks for device, display, and graphics surface
- **Impact**: Prevents crashes during device state transitions

#### **SwingDisplayComponent.java - Safe Device Access**
- **Issue**: Unsafe chained method calls without null checks
- **Fix**: Added proper null validation before device access
- **Impact**: Improves stability during emulator lifecycle events

### 4. **Code Quality Improvements**

#### **Raw Iterator Types Fixed**
- **Issue**: Raw iterator usage in mouse event handlers
- **Fix**: Replaced with parameterized types (`Iterator<SoftButton>`, `Enumeration<J2SEButton>`)
- **Impact**: Improves type safety and eliminates compiler warnings

#### **Defensive Programming**
- **Issue**: UIManager access could fail in headless environments
- **Fix**: Added proper exception handling and fallback values
- **Impact**: Improves robustness in different runtime environments

## üéØ TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Memory Testing**: Run emulator for extended periods to verify no memory leaks
2. **Thread Safety Testing**: Test concurrent access to FPS and filter systems
3. **Error Resilience**: Test behavior during device transitions and null states
4. **Performance Testing**: Verify no performance regression in rendering pipeline

## üìã MAINTENANCE NOTES

- **ThreadLocal Cleanup**: The shutdown hook will automatically clean buffers
